Humans have evolved with the unique ability of manipulating their lungs and vocal tracts to convey information to each other.  Although other animals produce and react to inter psecial vocalizations, humans have the amazing unique ability to produce and interpret these sounds, allowing them to impart knowledge about complex emotional states and information about the world we live in. The importance of speech to being human can be seen in the development of blind and deaf children.  Although both cases face hardships associated with their handicap, deaf children, denied of proper therapy, face challenges in social maturation that are not seen in blind children.

Because speech is such an essential human trait, the biological processes that are responsible for producing and perceiving it are the subject of continuous scientific research and development.  The microphone, in a general way, performs the same function as our inner ear, converting vibrations into a series of voltage fluctuations.  Modern computers can even mimic basic cognitive functions of the brain.

The purpose of this class is to study some underlying processes involved in speech production and perception.  This a priori knowledge can then be used to develop algorithms that allow us to digitally manipulate speech to benefit those suffering from diseases affecting speech production or perception.  It also allows us to communicate more.
